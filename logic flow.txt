Project name: AR Application
(As per our discussion with the EYIC proctors, we are sharing the logic flow of our project than the actual code, due to our project being dependent on Unity3D and Vuforia)

Project flow

Phase 1: target image 
/* the target image is first scanned by the scanner and uploaded on vuforia's website

*vuforia runs an algorithm where it looks for the sharp edges in the image and marks them 
These marks are then use to detecting an image 
The more edges the image has the more easier it can detect the image 

*vuforia generates a database file and a licence key 
*vuforia doesn't stores the whole image but just the map of the points it needs to detect the image 
Phase 2: 3d model 
*the complex 3d model are made using Autodesk Maya and adobe blender
*Unlike autocad where we work with sharp images Autodesk maya stitches two or more images together giving a desired edge we want 
It can be used to design anatomical structures.

*few simpler 3D models are made using basic spheres and cylinders found in unity itself
*Downloadable royalty free 3D models
* the final model is .obj file 

Phase 3: app development
*the app is made using unity 3D 
*deletion of main camera/importing AR camera (inbuilt vuforia integration)
*importing .obj file and image files in resources section
* importing database by vuforia and linking it through
License key 
*positioning of 3D models on top of the target image 
 Applying c# script for rotation and zooming in the 3d models 
*looking in for parent-child dependencies 
*adding labels in models if required 
*Building the app
